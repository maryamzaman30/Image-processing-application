## Graphics Programming - Image processing application

## Associated with University of London

For my final project in Semester 4, I created an image processing application using a webcam. I performed image manipulations like thresholding and color space conversions and implemented privacy-enhancing filters such as face blur and pixelation using p5.js, objectdetect.js, and objectdetect.frontalface.js. Additionally, I developed a unique extension: a webcam-based game where the character moves based on face detection. I documented the implementation in a commentary in sketch.js file.
